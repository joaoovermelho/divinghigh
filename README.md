# Diving High App

The objective that I pretend to achieve is creating a Web Application that embraces the Cliff Diving
theme. This project came from my big passion for Cliff Diving and for the lack of emphasis that the sport
has in Portugal.

I feel that creating a community that involves fans and unites them into creating unforgettable experi-
ences is something that will make me feel accomplished and I feel that is something that even I need.

This project is constituted by two websites, the one that demonstrates the sport and the user area, and
the respective ‘BackOffice’ that manages everything that relates to the website and the database.
