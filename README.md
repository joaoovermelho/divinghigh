# Diving High App

The objective that I pretend to achieve is creating a Web Application that embraces the Cliff Diving
theme. This project came from my big passion for Cliff Diving and for the lack of emphasis that the sport
has in Portugal.

I feel that creating a community that involves fans and unites them into creating unforgettable experi-
ences is something that will make me feel accomplished and I feel that is something that even I need.

This project is constituted by two websites, the one that demonstrates the sport and the user area, and
the respective ‘BackOffice’ that manages everything that relates to the website and the database.

# How to run the project

To run the project you need to have the following installed:

- XAMPP (or any other software that allows you to run a local server with PHP and MySQL)

After installing XAMPP, you need to start the Apache and MySQL services. Then, you need to clone the project into the htdocs folder of XAMPP.

After that, you need to import the database that is in the folder 'database' of the project. You can do this by going to 'localhost/phpmyadmin' and creating a new database with the name 'diving_high'. Then, you need to click on the database and go to the 'Import' tab. There you need to choose the file 'diving_high.sql' and click 'Go'.

After that, you can access the website by going to 'localhost/diving_high'.

For an admin user, you can access the 'BackOffice' by going to 'localhost/diving_high/admin/demo'.
